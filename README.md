# learningPython

Python is my second programming language (Java being my first).  Although I'm just beginning this learning journey, I can immediately see just how powerful Python is.  I decided to create a repository to store all the sample bits of code I've created and/or found in textbooks that I've played around with. Any code copied directly from textbooks is clearly sourced in a comment before the class. I hope this repository may be of use to some others who are also learning Python.

Cheers!
